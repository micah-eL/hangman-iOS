# hangman-iOS

Simple Hangman game for iOS.
Developed while self-learning Swift/SwiftUI as a way to get familiar with the syntax.
Because of this, it is a pretty 'hacky' app without any real app architecture and just using @State variables.
There are also some weird in-game nuisances such as the 'Confirm player 2' button.
