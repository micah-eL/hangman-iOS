# hangman-iOS

Simple Hangman game for iOS.
Developed while self-learning Swift/SwiftUI as a way to get familiar with the syntax.
Because of this, it is a pretty 'hacky' app without any real app architecture and just using @State variables.
There are also some weird in-game nuisances such as the 'Confirm player 2' button.

Originally I was going to randomly choose from a list of words when users start a new game.
However, I wanted something a little more interactive so I developed this as a 2-player game where 1 player picks the word and the other guesses.

To use the app, download the repo and open the Hangman directory in XCode.
Then connect your iPhone to your Mac and Build the app.
